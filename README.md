# Code-Refactor
In order to make this assignment more semantic I went through and adjusted a majority of the div tags to better fitting tags. I changed up some of the classes in HTML and CSS to make the CSS much more consolidated. There was a lot of repeat in the CSS. I added alt attributes to all of the images.  I added some comments throughout both my HTML and my CSS so that way another developer could look at it and see exactly where my head and where the project was headed. I also added alot of indentation to make the document easier to read and follow with all of the id, class and alt attributes it looked a bit overwhelming without proper indentation.
